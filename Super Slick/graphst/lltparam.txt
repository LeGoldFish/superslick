1 0.8 1

1. Number of nodes to look ahead in lap tracking.
2. // Ratio by which dir arrow should point along track regardless of position.
// 0.0 gives an arrow based on pos alone, which is poor on wide tracks.
// 1.0 gives an arrow based on the direction of lap tracking points,
// which doesn't react to the car position and so feels a little 'dumb'.
// Also, imperfections in placing the lap tracking points will cause the
// arrow to shake around a bit if the value is too near 1.0.
3. Turn on checkpoints for speedway (dodgy hack).
